# Fullstack Challenge
I am developing an online book sales website using PHP with the CodeIgniter 4 framework for the backend and React with Vite for the frontend.

# Backend (CodeIgniter 4):

<li>Data Management: Using CodeIgniter 4 to manage the database, handle business logic, and provide APIs for the frontend.</li>
<li>Security: Implementing security features such as user authentication and authorization, input validation, and protection against SQL Injection attacks.</li>
<li>Features: Providing features such as book search, inventory management, order management, and sales reports.</li>

to start project
# React
```bash 
npm i
```
and
```bash
npm run dev
```
# Codeigniter 4
```bash
composer install
```
and
```bash
php spark serve --port 4000
```
