# Fullstack Challenge
I am developing an online book sales website using PHP with the CodeIgniter 4 framework for the backend and React with Vite for the frontend.

# Backend (CodeIgniter 4):

<li>Data Management: Using CodeIgniter 4 to manage the database, handle business logic, and provide APIs for the frontend.</li>
<li>Security: Implementing security features such as user authentication and authorization, input validation.</li>
<li>Features: Providing features such as book search, inventory management, and order management.</li>

# Frontend (React with Vite):

<li>User Interface: Using React to build a responsive and dynamic user interface.</li>
<li>Optimization: Leveraging Vite to speed up the development and build process of the application.</li>
<li>Interaction with Backend: Implementing API calls to interact with the backend, including features like book search, adding items to the shopping cart, and user account management.</li>
